    "**ПРИВЕТСТВИЕ РЕВЬЮЕРУ**. Очень много времени у меня ушло на этот проект, очень много ядер полегло локально и на платформе Практикума, и на каггле, где в итоге и выполнял проект, хотя даже их 30 Гб RAM не хватало иногда в процессе подбора параметров лемматизатора, логистической регрессии и TfidfVectorizer'а. Оставляю закомментированные ячейки с частями кода, которые использовал по пути к побитию бейзлайна, чтобы были видны этапы работы. Понимаю, что проект может выглядеть сыровато, но после длительных мучений над метрикой хочется понять, в ту ли сторону я вообще шёл. "
